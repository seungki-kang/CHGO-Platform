# CHGO Platform Runtime and Security Audit 2.4 — Review 1.0

Review date: 2026-10-17  
Reviewed document: [`CHGO_Platform_Runtime_Security_Audit_2.4.md`](CHGO_Platform_Runtime_Security_Audit_2.4.md) (kept verbatim, SHA-256 `cdbf81cee975c3aabe3ee0e1d3a1c60390b39f8834dec42f703e79e39b0afe7b`)  
Repository state at review: `main` = `9eda66f`; open [PR #1](https://github.com/seungki-kang/CHGO-Platform/pull/1) = `fix/b02-e5-ci-runtime` (`3affddf`, `d284f5a`)  
Canonical/Governance meaning changes: none  
Decision: **Audit 2.4 is accepted as a remediation plan, not as closure evidence.**

## 1. Summary

Audit 2.4 identifies the same defect classes found in independent review and proposes sound corrections for most of them. Its "Corrected defects" section, however, describes a patch that is not in this repository:

- `main` is still the audited baseline `9eda66f`. No commit after it implements Audit 2.4.
- Files the audit names as added do not exist on `main`: `tools/validation/validate_b02_pack.py`, `tests/ci/`, `.gitattributes`.
- Every listed verification command is a static check. The highest-risk changes (FORCE RLS, cross-tenant constraint triggers, application-role grants, Vault owner RLS) are runtime behaviors and have no runtime evidence. Audit 2.4 itself lists PostgreSQL 16 execution as an open item.

Accordingly, each item below carries one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **VERIFIED (PR #1)** | Implemented in PR #1 and executed on PostgreSQL 16.15 |
| **PARTIAL (PR #1)** | Part of the item is implemented and executed in PR #1; the rest is not in the repository |
| **PLANNED** | Not in the repository; not executed |
| **PLANNED — RISK** | Not in the repository, and review found a defect or conflict in the described approach (Section 4) |

## 2. Status of "Corrected defects"

Items are numbered in the order they appear in Audit 2.4.

| # | Audit 2.4 item | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-01 | V002 case-insensitive unique index | **VERIFIED (PR #1)** | Duplicate hostname differing only in case is rejected |
| C-02 | B-02 shell scripts executable; preflight via `bash` | **VERIFIED (PR #1)** | Baseline failed with exit 126 |
| C-03 | Runners no longer query rolled-back `church_os_test.test_result` | **VERIFIED (PR #1)** | `.sh` executed; `.ps1` edited, not executed (no PowerShell) |
| C-04 | E5 evidence: exactly 12 PASS plus independent rollback log proof | **PARTIAL (PR #1)** | PR #1 judges each test and judges rollback only by PHY-T12. "Exactly 12" and log proof are stricter and not yet implemented |
| C-05 | System roles `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT`; system/tenant consistency constraint | **PARTIAL (PR #1)** | Uniqueness verified. Consistency constraint not implemented |
| C-06 | FORCE RLS on tenant tables; system-role read exception separated from write policy | **PARTIAL (PR #1) / RISK** | Policy split verified. FORCE RLS breaks non-superuser migration and backup (R-01) |
| C-07 | Application role: schema usage and DML on RLS tables only | **PLANNED — RISK** | R-05 |
| C-08 | Cross-tenant reference constraint triggers, including V010 FKs | PLANNED | Defect confirmed in review; correction not present |
| C-09 | `updated_at`/`row_version` triggers attached | PLANNED | Defect confirmed (no trigger attached in baseline) |
| C-10 | Outboxes reject Life Diary `narrative` | PLANNED | Defect confirmed (`narrative` payload accepted in baseline) |
| C-11 | Forced owner RLS on Vault version/grant/job tables; grant expiry mandatory | PLANNED | Defect confirmed |
| C-12 | Missing-safe `current_setting(..., true)` | PLANNED | |
| C-13 | Life Diary deleted sessions replaceable via partial active-session unique index | **PLANNED — RISK** | Conflicts with Flutter LD-FL-024 (R-02) |
| C-14 | Life Diary RESTORED event and UI draft persistence | PLANNED | Matches Flutter DB v2/v3 |
| C-15 | Separate payload/privacy-class columns for narrative and selections | **PLANNED — RISK** | Diverges from the Flutter storage schema (R-03) |
| C-16 | Flutter-shaped fixture validated, including empty Q6 `why` | **PLANNED — RISK** | Requires a Canonical meaning decision (R-04) |
| C-17 | Canonical UI labels carried by ID in the Flutter projection | PLANNED | |
| C-18 | Delta OpenAPI unique `operationId` values | PLANNED | All 20 Delta operations lack `operationId` on `main` |
| C-19 | Shared identity contract: bearer security, request bodies, grant fields | PLANNED | |
| C-20 | Structure validators use latest manifest and permit `.github` | PLANNED | |
| C-21 | R6 tests no longer depend on `/mnt/data` | PLANNED | 4 R6 tests fail on `main` for this reason |
| C-22 | Argument-taking scripts print usage instead of `IndexError` | PLANNED | |
| C-23 | `.gitattributes` makes LF/CRLF explicit | PLANNED | All 77 manifest 2.2 hash mismatches are explained by CRLF→LF |

Audit 2.4 "Additional defects found during remediation" A-1 to A-6 are design findings and are agreed. A-1 is incomplete without R-05.

## 3. Runtime evidence for VERIFIED items

Environment: PostgreSQL 16.15. Each `run:` step of `.github/workflows/e5-postgresql-runtime.yml` was extracted and executed the way GitHub Actions runs it (`bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail`).

| Workflow step | `main` (`9eda66f`) | PR #1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execute B-02 migrations and replay | FAIL (exit 126, `preflight.sh` not executable) | PASS |
| Execute dump drop recreate restore | skipped | PASS |
| Verify restored database (PHY-T01–T12) | skipped | PASS, 12/12 |

Fault injection on the evidence collector:

| Injected state | Baseline collector | PR #1 collector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHY-T05 = FAIL | runtime PASS | runtime FAIL_OR_INCOMPLETE |
| PHY-T12 = PENDING | rollback PASS | rollback FAIL_OR_INCOMPLETE |

System-role and RLS probe, executed as a non-owner role so that RLS applies:

- V009 executed three times leaves exactly 6 system roles. A duplicate system role code is rejected.
- A tenant session sees all 6 system roles and only its own tenant roles.
- Tenant UPDATE, re-assignment, and DELETE of system roles affect 0 rows. Creating a system role or another tenant's role is rejected by RLS.
- A tenant can insert, update, and delete its own roles.

## 4. Risks and conflicts in the described approach

### R-01 FORCE RLS breaks seeding and backup under a non-superuser owner (C-06) — verified

Reproduced on PostgreSQL 16.15 using the V004/V008/V009 structure with the Audit 2.4 policies and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`:

| Executing account | V009 system-role seed | `pg_dump` (first step of the E5 restore fixture) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Superuser (as in the E5 CI job) | succeeds | succeeds |
| Non-superuser schema owner (recommended for production) | **fails**: `new row violates row-level security policy` | **fails**: exit 1, `COPY` refused by the policy |

FORCE applies policies to the table owner, so system roles (`tenant_id` NULL) cannot be inserted and dumps are refused. Superusers bypass RLS, so the E5 job cannot detect this.

Required before FORCE is adopted:
- Run seeds and backups under a dedicated migration role with `BYPASSRLS`, or a reviewed equivalent.
- Add a non-superuser execution step to E5.

### R-02 Deleted-session policy conflicts with the Flutter application (C-13)

Audit 2.4 makes a deleted session number reusable through a partial unique index over active entries. Flutter LD-FL-024 ([Flutter PR #1](https://github.com/seungki-kang/CHGO-Life-Diary-Flutter/pull/1)) takes the opposite approach: deleted entries keep their number, so a tombstoned diary stays restorable.

Under the Audit 2.4 approach, restoring a deleted session whose number has been reused violates the partial index, and the restore fails. One policy must be chosen for both repositories. This review recommends number retention, because it guarantees restore.

### R-03 Contract and application storage diverge (C-15)

The contract would drop `payload_json` and `privacy_class` in favor of split columns. The Flutter application's SQLite schema (`lib/data/life_diary_database.dart`, version 3) still uses the combined columns, and no Flutter migration is planned.

"Contract validated" would then describe a schema that the application does not use. A Flutter database v4 migration that converts existing rows must be planned with C-15 and released together with it.

### R-04 Empty Q6 `why` requires a Canonical decision (C-16)

The runtime schema currently requires a non-empty `why` (`minLength: 1`). The Canonical register defines Q6 as recording to whom, what, and why the user is thankful. Relaxing the schema to accept the application's empty `why` is a meaning-level change, not a runtime-only change.

The Canonical owner must decide one of the following:
- Relax the contract.
- Have the application capture `why` separately.

### R-05 Application role cannot reach identity and tenant tables (C-07, A-1)

Limiting application-role DML to RLS-protected tables is the safe choice. As a consequence, the role cannot read `church_identity` or `church_tenant` tables, so sign-in and membership flows cannot run through it. A separately scoped service role for identity and tenant operations still needs to be designed. Until then, C-07 is a partial control, not a completed correction.

### R-06 Overlap with PR #1

C-01 to C-06 modify the same files and lines as PR #1. Both start from `9eda66f`, so applying them independently will conflict. Merge PR #1 first, then rebase the Audit 2.4 patch onto it.

## 5. Decisions required

| ID | Decision | Owner | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D-1 | Deleted Life Diary sessions: retain number (recommended) or allow reuse | Product + Life Diary engineering | C-13, Flutter LD-FL-024 |
| D-2 | Q6 `why`: relax contract or require capture in the application | Canonical governance | C-16 |
| D-3 | Migration and backup role design under FORCE RLS | Platform engineering + security | C-06 |
| D-4 | Service role for identity and tenant tables | Platform engineering + security | C-07 |
| D-5 | Flutter database v4 migration plan for split payload columns | Life Diary engineering | C-15 |
| D-6 | Merge order: PR #1 first, then rebase Audit 2.4 | Repository owner | C-01–C-06 |

## 6. Closure conditions for Audit 2.4

Audit 2.4 may be marked closed only when all of the following hold:

1. The Audit 2.4 patch is committed to this repository on top of PR #1.
2. The E5 job passes on that commit, including a non-superuser execution step (R-01).
3. Cross-tenant negative tests run as a non-owner role and their output is attached as evidence (C-08).
4. D-1 to D-5 are recorded as decisions.
5. The open items listed in Audit 2.4 itself remain open until their own evidence exists.

This review does not change Audit 2.4, Canonical wording, or Governance meaning.
